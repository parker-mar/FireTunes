# Introduction
#### Name
FireYouMusic

#### Description 
- What are you planning to build?
    - We are planning to build a firefox add-on which will allow users to play music from YouTube without having to have a tab where the music is played. 
    - The user will be able to rewind, play/pause, and fast forward music all through the add-on.
    - The goal of the addon is to enhance the personâ€™s web browsing and music experience by removing the music playing tab while still allowing the user to play, pause, and choose a song from YouTube without leaving the page they are currently browsing.

- Who are you building it for?
	- FireYouMusic's target audience is people who primarily listen to music through YouTube while using their computer.
	- FireYouMusic is designed for all age demographics. 
	
- Why would they find what you want to build useful/valuable?
    - User's who listen to music on YouTube waste a lot of time finding, and then selecting the YouTube tab whenever they want to pause their music, skip a song, or select a new song.
    - FireYouMusic will simplify user's music listening experience on YouTube and save users valuable time.

- How would one validate that what you built was useful?
    - FireYouMusic can easily be validated through user testing.
    - By selecting users who currently use YouTube to listen to music, we can track the time and ease of use before using FireYouMusic and after.
    - By directly comparing the results we can have a good estimation of how valuale FireYouMusic is for users. 

# Initial artifacts

#### Persona

Mike is a research assistant at University of Toronto. Due to the nature of his job he has to browse the internet for research for many
number of hours, his favourite browser is Firefox and he also likes to listen to Music on youtube while he is searching for articles. On
average Mike has 10 to 15 tabs open. For Mike this addon will eliminate the need to have a youtube tab, and choosing a song, or pausing
it could be done without having to switch to a new Tab. For mike this addon  will help him avoid distraction, and be more efficient in
his research.

#### Use Cases

	As an addon user, I want to search, and play music from Youtube without having the youtube tab added to my browser.
	As an addon user, I want to pause the song from within the page I am currently browsing.
	
#### System Components
- The minimum viable product is to support only YouTube. If possible we will extend the add-on to support other music services (Pandora,
- Spotify, etc.).
- Autoplay music(when one song finishes, move on to the next song).
- Load previously created playlists onto the system.
- Build a custom playlist, select multiple YouTube songs that will autoplay seamlessly. Another extension if time permits, would be to creation cross-platform playlists, (E.g. choose songs from YouTube, Pandora, Spotify, etc.).

# Plan

- We have roughly three weeks for add-on development.
- Weekly team meetings will be held to keep track of project progress.

Here is a week-by-week breakdown:
#### Week 1 (by March 11):
- Complete UI mockups of the add-on.
- Define user stories and major features for Minimal Viable Product.
- Prioritize features.
- Assign work to team members.

#### Week 2 (By March 18):
- Complete major UI implementation.
- Complete implementation on some of the key features.

#### Week 3 (By March 25):
- Complete implementation for all the features and user stories.
- Final testing and documentation.

#### What are some of the anticipated challenges? 
- The largest challenge will be understanding Firefox add-ons since no one on the team has experience with them.
- Another challenge will be utilizing the YouTube API since only one team member has experience with that.
- How to communicate effectively within a team of 6 will also be a challenge. 
	
#### How will you divide the work?
- We will list all components of the projects, and weight them by the numbers of hours they take as well as priority. 
- We plan to utilize the pair programming methodology in order to helpwith efficient collaboration. 
- We will list all the tasks, and then members will choose what task they prefer to do through round-robin voting.
